The report should be a maximum 6 pages plus references using this conference paper format. The report should also contain a link to your project code Github repository. Among the files in the repository should be a jupyter notebook that ideally should recreate the main results of your report. If some of your data is confidential then use some shareable data instead. For MSc students, please also include your poster in the submission.
